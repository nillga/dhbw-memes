      <p>The number '9' has always received a lot of fascination, mostly as a part of '19' or even '99' and their use in literature and so on. 
        Great examples are the heavy use of 9ish numbers in the complete works of the author Stephen King but also the 9 lives of a cat or 9 months 
        of pregnancy or even Dante's 9 circles of hell. <br>
        As the square of '3' it bears as well the trinity of trinities with a great example of a popcultural example being the three Star Wars 
        trilogies. The most interesting part about the number '9' results of our use of the decimal system: it is the biggest single digit numbers 
        and represents incomplete magnitude or some form of final infinity.
