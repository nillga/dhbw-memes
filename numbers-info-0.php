      <p>Math without '0' does not make sense. However, doing math with '0' explicitly does not make sense as well. 
      Fun fact: Our time calculation starts with the year '0'.<br>
      Zero (0) is the numerical equivalent for nothing (not literal, it does represent 'nothing' as in the absence of things, not absence of 
      meaning) and carries core importance to any mathematical action as such. <br>
      In fact the mathematically most important numbers are '0', '1', 'pi' and 'e' as well as the imaginary unit 'i'.
