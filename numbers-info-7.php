      <p>And yet another number connoted with mysticism and spirituality. It is almost a guaranteed member of a fairy-tale like the 7 dwarves 
        in Snow White and has also other interesting appearances: in the genesis, the world was created in a week that consists of '7' days: the sum 
        of the divine trinity (3) and the number of rationality (4). <br>
        But that is not everything: the number is liked a lot because of its mystical feeling and use, and we can see that it has been spread everywhere. 
        We got 7 sins and 7 virtues, 7-league boots and the 7 horcruxes of the Harry Potter septology.
